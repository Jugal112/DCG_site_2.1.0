From a very young age, my Dad ingrained the importance of saving and investing, and my interest in the market has grown ever since. For me, there are a few layers of intrigue to financial markets - the competing forces of psychology and multivariate systems, the possibility to achieve greater returns than highly regarded professionals, and the profound impact of those results.</p>
